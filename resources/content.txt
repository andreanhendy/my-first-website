HTML Essentials

HTML stands for HyperText Markup language and is a type of markup. Markup is extra instructional information you can add to content. HTML adds instructions to browsers on how content should be displayed.

HTML documents are text documents with the file extension ".htm" or ".html". They can be edited in any text editor but a dedicated code editor works best.

Web pages are made up of HTML Elements. HTML Elements are created with HMTL Tags. HTML Tags can have attributes to give them extra functionality.
